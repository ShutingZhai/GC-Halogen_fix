3. Entrainment-limited cloud uptake mechanism and cloud properties update in Holmes et al. (2019)
4. Reaction kinetics of HOBr+ Cl-/Br-  based on Roberts et al. (2014)
5. New mechanism for chlorine/bromine uptake in ice cloud based on IUPAC
6. Temperature dependence of BrNO3 hydrolysis based on Deiber et al.(2004)
7. New cloud pH calculation: use Jonathan Mok's fix and consider coarse mode aerosols
